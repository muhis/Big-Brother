# Big-Brother
A showcase of the ease of converting old smartphones into IOT devices. This project is mainly Python Django backend. The application has a front end component that reads location using HTML5 and post it to the server.


## Background
This project is as hacky student project as it can go. I had the need to bootstrap fast POC (proof of concept). The fast development ended up with endpoints *WITHOUT* security or authentication requirement. The endpoints also ended up being *not* so RESTful due to the authentication problems.  I didn't have time to implement a proper authentication layer and I had to dance around it. I discovered why my mom ordered me not to dance inside while dancing in this project.


## Production
The project worked fine. @TarekHiemstra and I tried it multiple times.

## Conclusion
I am rather happy with the proof of concept. I got the mental itch of creating tracking app since I read about HTML5 geolocation first time. I am now satisfied.
Done proudly in a good time before project deadline!
